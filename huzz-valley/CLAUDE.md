# Huzz Valley: project memory

A Roblox game based on Huss Valley: rounds where players steal and hold the lead, plus collectible anime companions ranked in tiers (Sub1, Sub3, Sub5, MTB, HTB, Stacy, True Eve), dances, quests and cosmetics. Work on the branch the session names (`HUZZ-VALLEY` so far).

**Gameplay doesn't exist yet.** Only the UI golden slice and its backend are built: saving, coins and gems, shop purchases and settings.

## Design authority
- The design kit is in `design/`:
  - `approved-original.png` is the approved look;
  - `pages/01-18` are the page references and `annotated/` the numbered positions;
  - `specifications/PAGE-POSITIONS.md` has the target rectangles;
  - `IMPLEMENTATION-PROMPT.md` has the full rules;
  - `CHARACTER-REPLACEMENT-MAP.md` has the model slots.
- Read only the page you're building.
- **Colours:** purple header with faint square studs; peach selected tab, navy inactive; periwinkle actions (never green); slate for done or disabled; small red close square.
- **Fonts (the owner's table; don't change them):**
  - window headings: Montserrat Black (Heavy) in caps with a thin dark outline;
  - names and product titles: Montserrat Bold, no outline;
  - tabs: Roboto Condensed Bold, in caps;
  - buttons: Roboto Condensed Bold with a minimal outline;
  - descriptions: Roboto Condensed Regular;
  - prices, currencies and XP: Montserrat Bold;
  - search fields and small labels: Montserrat Medium.
  - All of these live in `UI/Theme.lua` as `Theme.Fonts`.
- **Every colour and size is measured** from the references (the critic report's numbers are in `UI/Theme.lua`). Settings deliberately resizes per tab, because its references differ (Social 258 tall, Audio/Controls 287).
- **Robux prices:** every Robux price wears the Robux badge: U+E002, Roblox's own Robux mark, in dark navy before the number. Never use the kit's mockup hexagon (not official).

## Code map (`src/`, Rojo)
- `ReplicatedStorage/Shared`:
  - `Net` (every remote);
  - `Format`;
  - `Config/Products` (shop items: Id 0 = not created; `OnSale = false` = shows SOON);
  - `Config/Settings` (defaults and validation);
  - `Config/Assets` (icon IDs; empty until imported).
- `ServerScriptService/HuzzServer`:
  - `Bootstrap` (also makes the Master/Music/Effects SoundGroups);
  - `DataService` (ProfileStore; all changes go through `update()`);
  - `ShopService` (receipts and passes);
  - `SettingsService` (`allows()` answers social permissions, so any inventory or invite feature must call it);
  - `CosmeticsService` (trail and aura on the character).
- `StarterPlayerScripts/HuzzClient`:
  - `Main` (starts everything; applies audio, reduced motion, menu key and the VIP chat tag);
  - `UI/Kit` (the only component set: window, tabs, button, pill, segmented, slider);
  - `UI/ModalManager` (one window at a time; the player's `MenuOpen` attribute tells gameplay to ignore menu clicks);
  - `UI/Screens/*`.
- **Sizes are reference px** (as measured on the 768-wide pages). `UI/Scale.lua` applies one UIScale per window, about 1.82x at 1920x1080.

## Checks and previews (run before every commit)
- Put Lune on PATH: `/root/bin/lune`, or download 0.10.5 to `/root/bin`.
- `sh tools/preview/check.sh` must print `checks: N ok, 0 failed` (23 at the time of writing).
- `NODE_PATH=/opt/node22/lib/node_modules sh tools/preview/shots.sh <outDir> [names]` renders each screen under its reference page at 2x. Names: shop-passes, shop-cosmetics, shop-coins, settings-social, settings-audio, settings-controls, menu, lobby-hud.
- Copy the ones that changed to `docs/previews/` as JPEG.
- The renderer approximates Roblox:
  - the Robux glyph draws small;
  - the avatar is a grey stand-in;
  - icons come from `assets/icons` even before they're imported.
- `assets/icons` are the owner's icon files from the kit with only their baked-in background cleared (`python3 tools/icons/clear_background.py`, with per-icon settings in the script). **Never redraw or upscale them** (the owner's call).

## Open items (owner's checklist lives in `README.md`)
- **Built:** golden slice (Lobby HUD, Menu, Shop with 3 tabs, Settings with 3 tabs), waiting for the owner's look check in Studio.
- **Next:** roll the same Kit out to Index, Dances, Progression (Rewards and Quests), Tiers, Map Vote, Recruitment, Results and Gift Picker. Pages that need gameplay wait for the round system.
- **Missing from the owner:**
  - icon images imported in Studio;
  - Game Pass and Developer Product IDs;
  - companion models;
  - dance and pose animations;
  - outfit assets;
  - coin-stack art;
  - a petal texture.
- **Decided:** not-on-sale items show their price (Robux badge) but only say "coming soon" when tapped. Coin packs stay off sale until coins can buy something; Dance Pack until the dances exist; gifting is disabled until the Gift Picker and its backend exist.
